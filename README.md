- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ras-Py
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Raspberry Pi and Python mainly.
 

* Currently I'm working on a setup of an independent development environment for Python
  * Local instances of git, python package manager, docker repository
  * Low end services like dns, dhcp, boot via tftp, certificate authority
  * Build automation for docker based deployments
  * Support for local python environments, test automation
